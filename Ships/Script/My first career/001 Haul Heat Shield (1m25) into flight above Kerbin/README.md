At O.M.B Demolition Enterprises we're not afraid to try new things. As a result, we somethimes find ourselves in the situation of needing outside help to solve a problem. We don't actualy know how to attach a Heat Shield (1.25m) to other parts. From the bottom? The top? Is there even a way to tell which side is up? It would realy help us out if you're able to run a test.
